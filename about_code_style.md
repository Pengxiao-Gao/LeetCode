# Google Coding Style for C++

Google has a well-defined coding style for C++ that aims to improve code readability, maintainability, and consistency across projects. Following a consistent coding style can make code easier to understand and collaborate on. In this article, we will explore some of the key guidelines from Google's coding style for C++.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes and Structs**: Use `UpperCamelCase` for class and struct names.
- **Functions**: Use `UpperCamelCase` for function names.
- **Variables**: Use `lower_case_with_underscore` for variable names.
- **Constants**: Use `kConstantName` for constant names.

## Indentation and Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- Use spaces around binary operators.
- Use spaces after commas in function arguments and template arguments.
- Use spaces between control keywords and parentheses.
- Use braces for control statements, even if the body is a single line.

## Comments

- Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.
- Write comments in complete sentences.
- Use comments to explain the intent, not the mechanics of the code.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions for error handling instead of error codes.
- Handle exceptions at an appropriate level in the call stack.
- Document the exceptions that a function can throw.

## File Organization

- Each `.cc` file should have a corresponding `.h` file.
- Use include guards in header files to prevent multiple inclusion.
- Include headers in the following order: system headers, project headers, local headers.

## Miscellaneous

- Avoid using `using namespace` in header files. Instead, use fully qualified names.
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0` for null pointers.
- Avoid using macros. Prefer inline functions or constexpr variables.

These are just a few highlights from Google's coding style for C++. Following these guidelines can help improve the quality and maintainability of your C++ code. For more detailed information, refer to Google's official C++ style guide.

Remember, adhering to a consistent coding style is important for collaboration and code readability. Happy coding!
