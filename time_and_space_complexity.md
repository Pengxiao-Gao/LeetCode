# Time and Space Complexity

In computer science, time and space complexity are used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. They help us understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the input size increases.

## Time Complexity

Time complexity is a function that qualitatively describes the running time of the algorithm.

In our software development, time complexity is used to facilitate the developer to estimate the answer time for the programme to run.

So how to estimate the running time of the program? Usually, the number of operating units of the algorithm is estimated to represent the time consumed by the program, and here by default each unit of the CPU consumes the same amount of time to run.

Assuming that the problem size of the algorithm is n, then the number of operation units is represented by the function f(n), as the data size n increases, the growth rate of the algorithm's execution time is the same as the growth rate of f(n), which is called as the asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm, or time complexity for short, denoted as O(f(n)).

### What is the **O**
The explanation given by Introduction to Algorithms: **O** is used to denote an upper bound, when used as an upper bound on the worst-case running time of an algorithm, it is an upper bound on the running time for any data input.

Again Introduction to Algorithms gives the example: take insertion sort, the time complexity of insertion sort we all say is **O(n^2)**.

The form of the input data has a significant impact on the computation time of the procedure, in the case of data that is originally ordered the time complexity is O(n), but if the data is in reverse order, the time complexity of the insertion sort is O(n^2), that is, for all the input cases, the worst is the time complexity of O(n^2), so that the time complexity of the insertion sort is said to be O(n^2).

Similarly, if we look at fast sort, we know that fast sort is O(nlogn), but when the data is already in order, the time complexity of fast sort is O(n^2), so strictly speaking from the definition of big O, the time complexity of fast sort should be O(n^2).

However, we still say that the time complexity of quick sort is O(nlogn), which is a default rule in the industry, and the O here represents the general case, not a strict upper bound.
- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity. The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity. The algorithm's running time increases linearly with the input size.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity. The algorithm's running time increases quadratically with the input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity. The algorithm's running time increases logarithmically with the input size.

Understanding time complexity is crucial for choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

## Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how much memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem.

Common notations used to represent space complexity are:

- **O(1)**: Constant space complexity. The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage increases linearly with the input size.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage increases quadratically with the input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic space complexity. The algorithm's memory usage increases logarithmically with the input size.

Optimizing space complexity is important when dealing with limited memory resources.

## Conclusion

Understanding time and space complexity is essential for designing efficient algorithms. By analyzing the time and space requirements of an algorithm, we can make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization.

Remember, when it comes to algorithm efficiency, both time and space complexity matter!
