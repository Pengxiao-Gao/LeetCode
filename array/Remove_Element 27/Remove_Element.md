## Remove Element

Given an array `nums` and a value `val`, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [3,2,2,3]`, `val = 3`
Output: `2`, `nums = [2,2]`
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of `nums` being 2. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length. For example, if you return 2 with `nums = [2,2,3,3]` or `nums = [2,2,0,0]`, your answer will be accepted.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`
